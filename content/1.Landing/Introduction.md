This documentation exists primarily as a **personal knowledge base** and a way to share how I understand systems, tooling, and engineering concepts.

It reflects **my own perspective, experience, and mental models**.  
I might be wrong. I might oversimplify things. If something feels ambiguous or incorrect, **always cross-check with other sources**.




This documentation will consists of multiple major topics ranging from

### `DevOps`

<!-- This is where you [write pages](https://docus.dev/concepts/edition) in Markdown. -->

This section documents concepts, practices, and tools related to DevOps.
It focuses on how development and operations work together to deliver software reliably and efficiently.

Topics may include:

- CI/CD pipelines

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- Automation and monitoring

- Deployment strategies

- Tooling (Git, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)

Content here reflects practical experience, lessons learned, and real-world workflows rather than strict theory.


### `Cloud-Computing-Architecture`

Cloud architecture focuses on designing systems that run reliably on cloud platforms.
This section emphasizes why architectures are designed a certain way, not just how to deploy them.

Topics may include:

- Cloud fundamentals

- High availability and fault tolerance

- Scalability and cost optimization

- Security and identity management

- Real-world architecture decisions


### `Linux`

Linux is the foundational operating system behind most modern infrastructure.
This section focuses on understanding Linux as a working system — how processes run, how services behave, and how to debug things when they inevitably break.

Topics may include:

- Linux filesystem and permissions

- Process and service management

- Networking basics

- Shell scripting

- Troubleshooting and system administration

The focus is on hands-on usage and operational understanding rather than distribution-specific documentation.

### `Site Reliability Engineering`

SRE focuses on designing and operating systems that are reliable, scalable, and measurable.
This section explores how reliability is defined, measured, and protected in production systems.

- Topics may include:

- SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs

- Incident management and postmortems

- Monitoring and alerting

- Capacity planning

- Reliability vs. velocity trade-offs

<!-- <!-- This file contains all the dependencies and scripts for your application. The `package.json` of a Docus application si really minimal and looks like:

  },

Docus uses a layer system, you can go further and use any feature or file of a classical Nuxt project from `nuxt.config.ts` to `app/components` or `server/` directory.
