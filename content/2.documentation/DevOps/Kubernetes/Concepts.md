About [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is a theme based on the [UI documentation template](https://docs-template.nuxt.dev/).

There are plenty of other Kubernetes distribution, that you can use, if you do not choose to run the full-fledge production grade k8s

## So, What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (often called **K8s**) is a system that helps you **run, manage, and scale containerized applications** automatically.

Instead of running your app on one server and praying nothing breaks, Kubernetes lets you:
- run apps across **multiple machines**
- automatically **restart crashed apps**
- **scale up or down** when traffic changes
- deploy updates without downtime

It’s mostly used for **containerized applications** (usually with the help [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)).

---

## Why does Kubernetes exist?

Modern applications are:
- split into many small services
- deployed frequently
- expected to stay online 24/7

Managing this manually is painful and error-prone.

Kubernetes exists to:
- remove manual server babysitting
- standardize how apps run in production
- keep systems stable even when things fail (because things *will* fail)

---

## What problems does it solve?

Kubernetes helps with:

- **Application crashes** → restarts them automatically  
- **High traffic** → adds more app instances  
- **Low traffic** → removes unused ones  
- **Server failures** → moves apps elsewhere  
- **Deployments** → updates apps safely  

You describe *what you want*, Kubernetes handles *how* to keep it running.

---

## Core concepts (very high level)

You don’t need to know everything at once, but these names come up a lot:

- **Cluster** – a group of machines
- **Node** – a single machine in the cluster
- **Pod** – the smallest unit that runs your app
- **Service** – stable networking for pods
- **Deployment** – how apps are updated and scaled

---

## Kubernetes explained like you're 10 years old 🧒

Imagine you have **a lot of toy robots** doing jobs.

- Each robot can break sometimes
- Some days you need **more robots**
- Some days you need **fewer robots**
- You don’t want to fix or count them yourself

Kubernetes is the **robot manager**.

It:
- replaces broken robots
- adds more robots when needed
- removes extra robots when they’re not needed
- makes sure the work never stops

You just say:
> “I want 5 robots doing this job”

Kubernetes makes it happen.

---

## When should you use Kubernetes?

Kubernetes makes sense when:
- you run multiple services
- uptime matters
- scaling is important
- deployments happen often

It is **overkill** for:
- small personal apps
- simple single-server projects
- learning Docker basics

---

## Final thoughts

Kubernetes is powerful, but it’s not magic.

It trades:
- **simplicity** → for **reliability and scale**

Learn it slowly, one concept at a time.

You don’t need to master Kubernetes to use it —  
you just need to understand **what problem it’s solving**.
