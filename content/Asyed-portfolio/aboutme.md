# About Me

## Short Version

I’m a software engineer working in **automation and manufacturing systems**, currently transitioning deeper into **cloud-native and DevOps engineering**.

I enjoy building systems, breaking them, and understanding *why* they fail.

- Automation software for production and manufacturing lines  
- WPF + C# HMI development

## How I Learn

I learn best by:
- building small systems
- deploying them
- watching them fail
- fixing them properly

This site documents that process — not just the wins.

## Outside of Work

- Homelabbing and Linux tinkering
- Writing documentation in Obsidian
- Gaming, especially factory simulation games like Satisfactory and Factorio
- Music and guitar when my brain is fried
